      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section class="about-me scrollable-div">
        <p>Hello!
          <br><br>
          I'm Justine Biju Paul, born on Febuary 14, 2003. A dedicated Web Developer and Designer with a keen eye for
          crafting visually appealing
          and high-performing web experiences. With a background in computer science engineering, I blend creativity
          with technical expertise in every project I undertake.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          My journey into engineering began almost a decade ago with a simple yet pivotal experience. When a clock at
          home stopped working even after a battery change, curiosity got the better of me. Despite knowing my parents
          might not approve, I opened it up, eager to understand the mechanisms within. Carefully disassembling the
          gears, I marveled at how an electromagnet drove the movement, making each gear turn in sync. As I reassembled
          it, I noticed a misaligned gear, adjusted it, and was thrilled to see the clock come back to life. This early
          success sparked my love for engineering, the joy of solving problems, and the satisfaction of creating
          functional solutions.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy playing basketball (I was a member of my college team), exploring the web,
          listening to music, and diving into new areas of interest. Hackathons and collaborative projects inspire me,
          and I am continually motivated by the chance to create something impactful for people and communities.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I am committed to lifelong learning, technical problem-solving, and bringing fresh ideas to each challenge I
          face. I look forward to the opportunity to work together and create something exceptional.
        </p>
