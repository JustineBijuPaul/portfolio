      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section class="about-me scrollable-div">
        <p>Hello!
          <br><br>
          Iâ€™m Justine Biju Paul, born on February 14, 2003. As a dedicated Web Developer and Designer, I have a
          passion for creating visually engaging and high-performance web experiences. With a strong foundation in
          computer science engineering, I combine creativity with technical precision in each project I undertake.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My interest in engineering began nearly a decade ago with a defining moment. When a clock at home stopped working despite a battery change, curiosity led me to open it up, even knowing my parents might not approve. As I carefully examined the gears, I was fascinated by how an electromagnet powered each movement in sync. After noticing a misaligned gear, I adjusted it, and to my delight, the clock started ticking again. This early success sparked my passion for engineering, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of creating functional solutions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I enjoy playing basketball (having been part of my college team), exploring the web, listening to music, and diving into new fields of interest. Hackathons and collaborative projects particularly inspire me, fueling my drive to build impactful solutions for people and communities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With a commitment to lifelong learning, technical problem-solving, and innovative thinking, I bring fresh ideas to every challenge. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and create something exceptional together.
